# Insilico-drug-discovery
Performed virtual screening of 100 phytochemicals against the 1QGT receptor of Hepatitis B Virus. Evaluated binding affinity through molecular docking, followed by ADMET, toxicity and molecular dynamics (RMSD, RMSF) analyses to identify stable and safe lead compounds. Network and radar charts were generated for comparative visualization of ligands.
