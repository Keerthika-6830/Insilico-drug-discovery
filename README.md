**In-silico Drug Discovery of 1QGT Receptor (Hepatitis B Virus)**
**Overview**
This project focuses on identifying potential phytochemical inhibitors targeting the 1QGT receptor of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) using computational drug discovery methods.

**Summary**
Conducted virtual screening of 100 phytochemicals against the 1QGT receptor.
Assessed binding affinity and interactions via molecular docking.
Evaluated drug-likeness, ADMET properties, and toxicity using SwissADME and ProTox-II.
Performed molecular dynamics simulations (RMSD, RMSF) to confirm stability of lead compounds.
Generated network and radar charts for comparative visualization of ligand performance.

**Objectives**
Identify stable and safe lead compounds against HBV
Analyze binding affinity and molecular interactions
Evaluate pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity
Perform molecular dynamics simulations to assess structural stability

**Tools & Software**
Docking & Screening: PyRx,discovery studio
ADMET & Toxicity: SwissADME, ProTox-II
